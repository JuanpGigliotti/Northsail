        <div class="sobrenosotros-historia">
            <p class="historia__texto">In 1957, North Sails founder Lowell North set out to make the fastest, highest-quality racing sails that had ever existed. He achieved it, and changed the world of sailing forever. Today, whether for the America's Cup winner, the Vendée Globe champion, an Olympic superstar or an amateur sailor, every sail we make is born from the winning spirit and absolute dedication to the sport we love.
                <br><br><br>

                Lowell's legacy lives on. It's the combination of cutting-edge technology and high-performance materials that also defined the first North Sails Apparel collection introduced in 1989 and the North Sails Actionsports collection that followed.

                    When he founded North Sails, his philosophy was very simple: Get the best and commit to making the best product. Act clearly, creatively, methodically and with a competitive spirit. Go beyond what you ever imagined.
                    
                    For more than six decades, teams powered by North Sails have achieved remarkable results.

                    For Performance garments, the single goal is to create the best bad-weather gear on the planet, while Lifestyle collections bring the spirit of the ocean to the coast and the city, combining classic Italian design with our valuable sailing pedigree and environmentally friendly materials.</p>
